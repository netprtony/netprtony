## 🚀 **Projects**
### 🔗 [Weather Image Recognition](https://github.com/netprtony/CNN_PridictionWeather)  
- Built with TensorFlow and OpenCV.  
- Achieved 95% accuracy in recognizing 50+ object classes.  

### 🔗 [RFID-System-PSO](https://github.com/netprtony/RFID-System-PSO)  
- The project utilizes the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to address the RFID Network Plan-
ning (RNP) problem, focusing on optimizing reader placement to achieve maximum coverage, reduce in-
terference, and minimize deployment costs. PSO is evaluated and compared with other swarm intelligence
algorithms, particularly the Firefly Algorithm (FA), demonstrating its superiority in several aspects.
